The Consent & Privacy Management Service is a backend microservice built using Node.js and MongoDB to support compliance with data protection regulations such as DPDP (India) and GDPR (Europe).
It allows applications to:

✅ Track when a user gives or revokes consent (e.g., for marketing emails or data sharing).

✅ Maintain a log of all consents given by a user.

✅ Enable users to request deletion of their personal data.

✅ Store all consent actions in a secure and structured format in a MongoDB database.

This microservice is part of a broader microservices architecture and is responsible for ensuring that user data is handled transparently and respectfully in accordance with legal requirements.
